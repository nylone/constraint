# Constraint
Constraint is a simple 1v1 game inspired by tic-tac-toe, but with a twist

# Rules

The game is played in turns, every player gets 1 turn per round.

During their turn, a player has to place its mark following the "constraint":
>   you may only place your mark in one of the empty slots surrounding the last mark placed by your opponent

The constyraint obviously isn't applicable during the turn of whoever plays first

It's easier to explain how to lose rather than how to win

> A player has lost once no more legal placements of their mark are possible
